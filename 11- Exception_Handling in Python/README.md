**Exception Handling**

Exception handling in Python is a way to manage errors that may occur during the execution of a program. Instead of letting the program crash, you can "catch" exceptions and decide how to handle them gracefully.

**Basic Syntax** 

try:
    # Code that might raise an exception
    x = 1 / 0
except ZeroDivisionError:
    # Code that runs if a ZeroDivisionError occurs
    print("You can't divide by zero!")
